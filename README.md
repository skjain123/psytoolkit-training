Training repository for PsyToolKit Experiment Creation

Here is the official documentation for PsyToolKit:
https://us.psytoolkit.org/doc3.4.6/syntax.html

For developing code, I reccommend using VSCode but it does not matter
    as long as you dont use the psytoolkit editor.

Develop your code externally, and copy/paste it into psytoolkit.
